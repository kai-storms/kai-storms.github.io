While the technical development of automated driving functions has made significant progress in the past decade, there is still no validation method. An assessment of automated driving before the market launch is difficult because, except for test drives on real roads, there is no information about the behavior of automated vehicles in real traffic. Due to the high level of safety in today’s traffic, it is not economically feasible to prove the superiority of automated driving by test drives only, because it would require a testing distance of several million to billion kilometers. To shift testing to simulation or test tracks, information about critical test scenarios is necessary. The Virtual Assessment of Automation in Field Operation (VAAFO) helps to gain more knowledge about automated driving functions while using series vehicles in today’s traffic. The new function is tested virtually, and at the same time, information is gained to deduce test scenarios for testing on test tracks and simulation.
